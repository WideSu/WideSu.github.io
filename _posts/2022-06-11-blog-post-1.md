This week, I want to share two papers about speech enhancement network.
- 1. [PHASEN: A Phase-and-Harmonics-Aware Speech Enhancement Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04697.pdf)
- 2. [UltraSE: Single-Channel Speech Enhancement Using Ultrasound](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3447993.3448626)

# Background of speech enhancement
Speech enhancement is used to extract audio from noices. Classical solutions need to rely on prior knowledge (i.e., per-speaker feature engineering) [1] or directional microphone arrays [2] to isolate the desired source from ambient sounds.

## Innovation

In this paper, we propose UltraSE, which uses ultrasound sensing as a complementary modality to separate the desired speaker’s voice from interferences and noise. UltraSE uses a commodity mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to emit ultrasound and capture the reflections from the speaker’s articulatory gestures. It introduces a multi-modal, multi-domain deep learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and the audible speech spectrogram. Furthermore, it employs an adversarially trained discriminator, based on a cross-modal similarity measurement network, to learn the correlation between the two heterogeneous feature modalities. Our experiments verify that UltraSE simultaneously improves speech intelligibility and quality, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.
