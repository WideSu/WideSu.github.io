Today, I want to share with you the basic derivative and pricing models.

And here is an interesting [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrBzl0DMBA) on this topic

# What's derivative?
Derivative is a contract created between two parties about an underlying asset. And the asset can be cars, houses, crude oil, certificate, etc.

# How many types of derivatives are there in the market?

- Future
- Forward
- Swap
- Option

## What's forward?
One of the oldest and most commonly used derivatives is the forward contract, which serves as the conceptual basis for many other types of derivatives that we see today. Here, we take a closer look at forwards and understand how they work and where they are used.

How to make money in this contract? You can sell your side when the market price change. For example, when the bike prive goes up, the seller can sell his side before the contract and earn the difference of price.

Notice that in finance, the **buyer** is called short side, the **seller** is called long side. And there is no win-win situation. When one side earn, the other lose.
